Restaurant Scheduling System
The Restaurant Scheduling System is a web-based application that allows customers to request appointments and make reservations at a restaurant. It provides an intuitive user interface for customers to view available dates and times, submit their booking requests, and receive automated reminders. The system also includes an admin interface for restaurant staff to manage reservations, handle booking requests, and communicate with customers.

Features
Customer Appointment Request: Customers can view available dates and times through a calendar interface and submit their booking requests.
Form Validation and CAPTCHA: Required customer information, such as name, email, phone number, and the number of persons, must be entered correctly. CAPTCHA integration protects against spam bots.
Optional Message: Customers can include an optional message with their booking request to provide additional details or special requests.
Automated Email Notifications: Customers receive automated email and SMS reminders two hours before their reservation time. The system sends an email to the restaurant's account with the customer's input data upon request submission.
Admin Dashboard: Restaurant staff can access a secure admin dashboard to manage reservations, review booking requests, communicate with customers, and view relevant analytics.
Data Storage: The system securely stores customer data, reservation details, and booking requests in a database.
